# Bonzai 2 Customer Demo Script

> **Duration:** 10 minutes  
> **Audience:** Customers migrating from Classic Bonzai to Modern SharePoint  
> **Goal:** Show them Bonzai 2 is familiar, easy to deploy, and they can do it themselves  
> **Mindset:** Empathetic, calm, empowering — they may be frustrated about the deadline

---

## Demo Strategy

### Key Principles
1. **Familiarity first** — Show web parts that look/work like Classic Bonzai
2. **Ease of use** — Emphasize visual pickers, no code, self-service
3. **Quick wins** — Focus on what works well, skip error states
4. **Empowerment** — "You can do this" messaging throughout
5. **Resources available** — Documentation site, support portal

### Pages to Demo (In Order)
| Order | Page | Why | Duration |
|-------|------|-----|----------|
| 1 | **Home** | Best first impression, multiple web parts | 2 min |
| 2 | **News & Communications** | Core communication use case | 1 min |
| 3 | **People & Directory** | Employee search, locations — common need | 1.5 min |
| 4 | **Quick Links** | Simple, always works | 1 min |
| 5 | **Search** | Powerful feature, unified search | 1 min |
| 6 | **Events & Interactives** | RSVP, Feedback — interactive | 1.5 min |

## Demo Script (10 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Let me show you Bonzai 2 — this is what you'll be working with. The good news is, if you've used Classic Bonzai, this will feel very familiar. Same web parts, same concepts, just modernized for SharePoint Online."

**[Share screen — Home page]**

---

### 1. Home Page (2 minutes)

**[Show the full page first]**

> "This is a typical Bonzai intranet homepage. Notice you have your hero slider at the top, news cards, favorite sites, and favorite documents — all the elements you're used to."

**[Scroll to Slider]**

> "The **Slider** web part works just like before — it pulls promoted content and rotates through announcements. Open Enrollment, company updates, that sort of thing."

**[Scroll to News Rollup]**

> "**News Rollup** displays your SharePoint news articles. You can choose different templates — cards like this, list view, or tiles. Categories, dates, comments — all there."

**[Point to Favourite Sites and Favourite Documents]**

> "Users still have their **Favourites** — sites and documents they've starred. Personal, per-user. No configuration needed — it just works with their SharePoint profile."

**[Click Edit on the page — show property pane briefly]**

> "Configuration is all done through the property pane — no code. You pick your list, choose a template, set how many items to show. Very visual, very intuitive."

**[Close edit mode]**

---

### 2. News & Communications (1.5 minutes)

**[Navigate to News & Communications page]**

> "This page shows your **Important Messages** and **News Rollup** together."

**[Point to Important Messages - empty state]**

> "Important Messages is connected to a SharePoint list. Right now there are no active messages — but when you add one with today's date, it appears automatically. Info, Warning, Error, Success — color-coded just like Classic."

**[Point to News Rollup cards]**

> "News articles with images, categories, like counts, comment counts. Clicking any card takes you to the full SharePoint page. This is all coming from your Site Pages library — no separate content database."

---

### 3. People & Directory (1.5 minutes)

**[Navigate to People & Directory page]**

> "People and directory features — essential for any intranet."

**[Point to Employee Directory]**

> "**Employee Directory** with search and A-to-Z filtering. Users can quickly find colleagues by name. This connects to your Microsoft 365 user profiles."

**[Point to Locations section]**

> "And **Locations** — your office directory. Each card shows address, phone, email, and a 'Get Directions' link. London, New York, Seattle — wherever your offices are."

**[Point to Site Directory if visible]**

> "**Site Directory** lets users discover and favorite SharePoint sites across your organization. Search-enabled, with star icons for quick access."

---

### 4. Quick Links (1 minute) — Can Skip If Short on Time

**[Navigate to Quick Links page]**

> "Quick Links uses the **Advanced Links** web part. Tiles, icons, descriptions — you define these in a SharePoint list."

**[Point out the link tiles]**

> "Microsoft 365, HR Portal, IT Help Desk, Expense Reports — common shortcuts. You can also enable content targeting so different users see different links based on their department or location."

**[Point to Favourite Sites]**

> "And again, Favourite Sites appears — users can access their pinned sites from any page."

---

### 5. Search (1 minute)

**[Navigate to Search page]**

> "One of the most powerful features — **Advanced Search**."

**[Point to the search box and filters]**

> "Unified search across your entire SharePoint. Type ahead suggestions, refinement filters on the left — by content type, date, author. This consolidates what used to be multiple Classic web parts into one."

**[Type a search term if data exists, or just point to the layout]**

> "Results show pages, documents, sites, events, news — all in one place. Pagination at the bottom. This replaces the old Search Box and Search Refinement web parts."

---

### 6. Events & Interactives (1.5 minutes)

**[Navigate to Events & Interactives page]**

> "Here we have **Events Rollup** and **Feedback**."

**[Point to Events Rollup]**

> "Events with dates, locations, and — importantly — RSVP functionality. Users can click 'Attend' and you see attendance counts. Connected to a SharePoint calendar or events list."

**[Point to Feedback web part]**

> "**Feedback** lets users submit quick feedback — star ratings, categories, optional anonymous mode. Great for pulse surveys, page feedback, suggestions. All stored in a SharePoint list you control."

---

### 7. Admin — Theme Manager (1.5 minutes) ⭐ Wow Moment

**[Navigate to Admin page]**

> "Now, this is new in Bonzai 2 — the **Theme Manager**."

**[Point to the Theme Manager interface]**

> "In Classic, you had to edit configuration files or use the Brick Theme Editor. Now it's all visual, right on the page."

**[Click through quick theme presets if available]**

> "Quick presets to get started. Or customize everything — primary color, background, text, accent colors."

**[Change a color — show live preview]**

> "Watch the preview card update in real time. You can see exactly how your theme will look before saving."

**[Point to corner styles and dark mode]**

> "Corner styles — sharp, rounded, or pill. And dark mode toggle — the entire Bonzai experience respects this."

**[Click Save if appropriate, or Reset to undo]**

> "Click Save, and your theme applies across all Bonzai web parts on this site. No deployments, no code changes."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**[Navigate to documentation site or show URL]**

> "Everything I've shown you is documented at **document.bonzai-intranet.com**. Step-by-step guides, configuration reference, troubleshooting. And if you need help, there's a link to our support portal on every page."

> "The package is downloadable from GitHub. You upload it to your App Catalog, deploy to your sites, and start adding web parts. We're here to help with questions, but you have everything you need to get started."

**[Stop sharing]**

---

## Handling Common Questions

### "Can we migrate our existing pages automatically?"
> "There's no one-click migration tool — the UI and layouts are too different between Classic and Modern. But the strategy is to start fresh with critical pages, gradually migrate content over the next few months, and archive the old. Akash is working on an analysis tool that can inventory your existing web parts to help plan the migration."

### "How long does deployment take?"
> "Deploying the package takes about 5 minutes. Adding web parts to a page — a few minutes per page. Most customers start with one critical page and iterate from there."

### "Is the license free?"
> "Your license is managed by your account manager. The package is gated — it checks license status before web parts work. Your account team can update your license status anytime."

### "Can we get support?"
> "Yes — there's a support portal linked throughout the documentation. For installation help, questions about specific web parts, or migration strategy, reach out there."

### "What about permissions — can we restrict who edits web parts?"
> "That's managed by SharePoint's permission model. If a user can edit a page, they can edit web parts on it. For more granular control, you'd use SharePoint's page permissions or section-level permissions."
